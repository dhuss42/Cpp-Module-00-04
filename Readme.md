## C++ - Module 00 
This module introduces core concepts in C++ such as namespaces, classes, member functions, initialization lists, static and const members, and other basic topics, through hands-on exercises to help build a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming.

### Exercise 00: Megaphone

I created a program that converts input text to uppercase and outputs it. If no arguments are given, the program outputs a loud noise. This exercise helped me practice handling command-line arguments and working with strings in C++.

### Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook

Objective: I implemented a simple phonebook program using two classes: PhoneBook and Contact. The phonebook can store a maximum of 8 contacts and handles three commands: ADD, SEARCH, and EXIT. This exercise allowed me to practice implementing user interaction through the console.

### Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams

Objective: I recreated the Account class after its implementation was lost. By using the provided header file and log files, I wrote the missing source code to match the log output. This exercise focused on class implementation and understanding how the components of a program can interact to fulfill a task.


## C++ - Module 01 
This module introduces key concepts in C++ such as memory allocation, pointers, references, and switch statements, through a series of practical exercises.

### Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

I implemented a Zombie class with a name attribute and a function to announce itself. I also learned when to allocate memory on the heap versus the stack by creating zombies using two different methods.

### Exercise 01: Moar brainz!

I created a zombieHorde function to allocate a specified number of zombies in a single memory allocation. This exercise helped me practice dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

### Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN

I demonstrated the use of pointers and references by printing memory addresses and values of a string and its pointer/reference. This helped me understand address manipulation in C++.

### Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence

I implemented Weapon, HumanA, and HumanB classes to handle different initialization patterns for the weapon. This exercise taught me about class relationships and the use of member functions.

### Exercise 04: Sed is for losers

I wrote a program to read a file, replace occurrences of a given string with another, and output to a new file. This exercise focused on string manipulation and file handling without using std::string::replace.

### Exercise 05: Harl 2.0

I automated Harl’s complaints by creating a Harl class with functions for different complaint levels. I learned how to implement a function that selects the appropriate complaint based on input.

### Exercise 06: Harl filter

I filtered and displayed Harl’s complaints based on a log level input. Using a switch statement, I displayed complaints from the given level and above, helping me practice control flow in C++.
